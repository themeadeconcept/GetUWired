This is a navigation bar Test I had to complete for a company, GetUWired.

Through this test I had to apply my pure CSS and HTML skills to create a drop down menu.

Requirements were to replicate it as closely as possible with given User Endpoints.

I Had to match:

- Hover states
- Colors
- Fonts
- Margin's / Padding, etc
- Content

Enjoy
